# csv-to-flask-pipeline
ðŸ’¡ **Full Project Description (for README or About section):

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data pipeline using Python, integrating CSV ingestion, data transformation with Pandas, and data storage using SQL databases, all managed through a Flask web interface.

The main goal is to automate the process of:

Uploading and reading raw CSV files,

Cleaning and transforming the data with Pandas,

Inserting the processed data into a SQL database (like SQLite or MySQL), and

Optionally visualizing or managing the records via Flask routes.

This beginner-friendly project showcases how to connect backend data processing with a lightweight web framework â€” a solid foundation for data-driven web applications and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines.
